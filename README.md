# Eliseu on Rails

This is my personal blog, where I'll make posts about my learnings and experiences through my career transition from Customer Service/Experience to Ruby on Rails developer.

## About the blog

* Posts will be made in Brazilian Portuguese, at start. Maybe later I'll add translations to English and Spanish;
* Only admins (me) will be able to create new posts
* Signed in users will be able to like and comment on posts
* The main focus will be on the back-end and Rails part of the blog, but I'll give my best to make it look nice;
